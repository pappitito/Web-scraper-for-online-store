# Web-scraper-for-online-store
Web scraper built for an online store's flash sale.

##Reason behind this:

jumia(an online store) was having a flash sale for iphone 13, and in order to find it you need to constantly
search for the phone in over 1000 search results for iphone 13. this led me to building this webscraper to automate
the search and send me an email with the page link when the iphone 13 with the specific flash sale price has been found. the time in which jumia was going
to carry out the price slash was unknown so the program is built to recurrently scrape until jumia has slashed the price and the program finds it.
